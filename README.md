go-redirector aka "PlanetVegeta"

A reasonably fast (see perf data below) server that redirects users. It does this by offering a descriptive rendered html page with enough javascript which waits 15 seconds before redirecting the user to the correct URI.

All aspects of the html can be edited.
The server can contain multiple mapped entries of host:path -> destination.

Can be run as a docker container, and comes in at ~ 13MB in size.


## Versions

Versions:
  - `0.2.1`:
    - fix bug when some paths when empty return a trailing slash
    - further clarify what characters may not be present in paths
  - `0.2.0`:
    - added new structure for each path entry, specifying `friendly` (bool, optional, default=true) which when false sends a direct 302, instead of a friendly page. See section _Mapping File_ below in docs.
    - swapped out logrus with zerolog
    - improved performance and latency
  - `0.1.3`:
    - general improvements found through tests

## Mapping File

### Format
Each mapping entry has two values which _MUST_ be set.
1. `immediate`: (bool, optional) false shows a friendly html page with a javascript redirect, otherwise client will receive an immediate 302 (proper for direct GET requests and where you don't want SEO resource link updates).
2. `redirect`: (string) path starting with `/`. Can be explicitly `/` or `*` to denote being a wildcard. The author personally prefers `/`.

### Sample

The mapping example below creates an entry for host `testhost`.
This host named `testhost` has two path entries.
  1. `/my-path` - a specific path
     - paths cannot have params (`/pathA?page=1`), only redirects may
     - paths cannot be fragments (`/pathA#fragment`), only redirects may
     - paths OR redirects **cannot** have runes (`"/\x7f#fragment"`) 
  2. `/` or `*` - presence of a root path `/` is the equivalent of specifying a wildcard. If you wish to exclude this path, then only matching paths (in this case `my-path`) will redirect, all others will return `404`.


Preferred:
```yaml
---
mapping:
  testhost:
    "/my-path":
      immediate: true
      redirect: https://localhost:8081
    "/":
      redirect: https://localhost:8082
```

Alternative Equivalent:
```yaml
---
mapping:
  testhost:
    "/my-path":
      immediate: true
      redirect: https://localhost:8081
    "*":
      redirect: https://localhost:8082
```

## Devs

```shell
go mod tidy
go fmt ./...
golint ./...
golangci-lint run ./...
```

## Example Usage

1. Edit or supply (via bind mount) the map file: `redirect-map.yml` file.
1. Use the supplied template or provide your own: `/views/html.tpl`
1. Run the image

By default, this server starts in TLS mode, and listens on port 8443. You can change how the server operates with various flags. See the examples below on how.


### Examples

TLS Is enabled by default but no certs are provided.
Other flags which may be useful are:
  - `--cert <file>` defaults to `./certs/server.pem`
  - `--key <key>` defaults to `./certs/key.pem`
  - `--port <port-number>` defaults to `8443` unless specified
Below we bind the local directory containing `server.pem` and `server.key`.
This will allow the server to run.
```shell
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  -v ./certs:/certs \
  -v $(pwd)/redirect-map.yml:/redirect-map.yml \
  ghcr.io/ecri-org/go-redirector:latest \
  /go-redirector run
```

To run in HTTP mode you must supply the `-http` flag.
Other flags which may be useful are:
- `-port <port-number>` defaults to `8080` in `http` mode unless specified
```shell
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/redirect-map.yml:/redirect-map.yml \
  ghcr.io/ecri-org/go-redirector:latest \
  /go-redirector run --http
```

## Performance Data

### v0.2.0 performance mode

versions `0.2.0` and greater

TLDR: `94483.98 [#/sec] (mean)`

Lower latency and handles ~300% the number of requests based on this simple test. 

Runs with logging set to 'error' and in http mode: `run --performance-mode`

### Fiber Implementation

versions `0.1.1` - `0.1.3`

TLDR: 32583.95 [#/sec] (mean)

The Fiber implementation based on fasthttp is slightly faster.
More importantly it is easier to implement.
